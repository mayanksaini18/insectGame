# 🕹️ Catch The Insect - A Web Game

**Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

A fun, reflex-testing browser game where you pick your "enemy" – 🦟 Mosquito, 🕷 Spider, or 🪳 Roach – and try to catch them as they randomly appear on the screen.

> Inspired by the recent dengue scare in our hostel – this is a developer’s way of fighting back, one mosquito at a time 😄
